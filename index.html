          <li>
            <em>Social disorganization theory </em>(SDT) is a macro-level theory 
            that explains the distribution of crime rates across areas based 
            on structural and cultural factors shaping the nature of social 
            order, not on why any one individual may be more or less likely to 
            engage in criminal acts than another (Kubrin 2010).
          </li>
          <li>
            Social disorganization can be defined as the inability of a 
            community to realize the common values of its residents and maintain 
            effective community-based <em>social controls</em> (Bursik 1988).
            <!-- Social control is a concept referring to the rules and 
              restrictions that shape, supervise, and regulate the behaviors of 
              individuals and their societies. These can exists at informal 
              (interpersonal relationships used to shame or praise) or formal 
              (laws, rules, and regulations) forms of control. -->
          </li>
          <!-- 
            Bursik notes that disorganization is more likely in areas of 
            economic deprivation, which in the historical context that we will 
            cover later on mean areas with high rates of population turnover and 
            heterogeneity. He, and others, argues that these two processes 
            increase disorganization because of:
              1. The difficulty in forming institutions pertaining to internal 
                controls as many residents are in flux
              2. The weakness of the social networks required to form informal 
                structures of social control when people are coming and going
              3. Heterogeneity impedes communication and obstructs the quest to 
                solve common problems
           -->
          <li>
            A key assumption is that communities can be classified on a 
            continuum of disorganization, from high to low. Here, highly 
            disorganized communities experience more crime (Kubrin 2010).

              Shaw and McKay applied the ideas of human ecology and the 
              concentric zone model to study the association between urban 
              characteristics and juvenile delinquency. On the basis of this
              research they developed SDT.
            </li>
            <li>
              By hand, they mapped the addresses of juvenile delinquents - those 
              referred to juvenile court, truancy, and recidivism - and compiled 
              them into small census areas and city zones. Then they examined 
              delinquency in Chicago communities for three periods of time: 
              1900-1906, 1917-1923, and 1927-1933.
            </li>
            <li>
              Their study of social disorganization centered around three sets 
              of variables:
              <ul>
                <li>

                Crime rates were pronounced in the transition zone and became 
                progressively lower as one moves to the outer zones.
                  <!-- 
                    Surrounding the industrial area was a ring characterized by 
                    high levels of physical, economic, and population factors 
                    they were studying and a corresponding high delinquency. As 
                    one moved towards the outskirts of the city, they found a 
                    reduction in these characteristics and delinquency. 
                    
                    Additionally, Low crime areas in the the peripheral 
                    neighborhoods are more upper middle class, stable population 
                    with more homogeneous demographics.
                  -->
                </br>
                They proposed that population shifts influenced delinquency 
                because of the process of invasion, dominance, and succession.
                  <!--
                    Recall, zones in transition were close to industry... 
                    The process they proposed was where members of one ethnic 
                    group moved into another group's neighborhood. The 
                    disruption in organization caused a rise in crime that would 
                    incrementally get worse until the invading group became the 
                    majority, then crime would rates would return to near their 
                    previous level.

                As the number of families receiving social assistance increased 
                there was a rise in delinquency. Delinquency rates dropped as 
                the median rental price of the area rose. Finally, they 
                uncovered a negative relationship between home ownership and 
                delinquency.

    <!-- EXTRA NOTES:

      On the basis of their findings, Shaw and McKay (1942) concluded that the 
      ecological conditions existing in areas with high delinquency were 
      contributing to a breakdown in the social order of the area, resulting 
      in conditions conducive to delinquency. 

      Zone in transition was characterized by low socioeconomic status, ethnic 
      heterogeneity, and residential instability.
      - LOW SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS: There are inadequate resources in these areas 
        and the residents live in poverty.
      - ETHNIC HETEROGENEITY: Different racial and ethnic groups live together 
        in these areas, and differences in culture and language create barriers. 
        People isolate themselves, avoid meaningful interaction, and don't have 
        much in common.
      RESIDENTIAL INSTABILITY: There is constant population turnover. Residents 
        move frequently or are looking to move out of these areas.

      <!-- 
        Shaw and McKay did not supply a refined discussion on this concept. They
        suggested the characteristics of socially disorganized neighborhoods -
        poverty, turnover, and heterogeneity - lead to disorganization and a
        breakdown of social institutions in a community. 
        
        In the context of their work, the lack of effective social control and 
        organizations (e.g., churches, schools, families) meant that the youths 
        were free to the type of social controls found in more affluent areas.

        A direct effect of social disorganization on delinquency is that it 
        produces a loss of informal social controls (or the reactions of 
        individuals and groups that bring about conformity to norms and laws, 
        includes peer and community pressure, bystander intervention in a crime, 
        and collective responses such as citizen patrol groups). For example, 
        limited parental supervision would mean little supervision of what they 
        do and who they come into contact with. Youths could go commit delinquent 
        acts while unsupervised.
        
        An indirect effect of social disorganization on delinquency is that 
        delinquent traditions are transmitted across generations of youths. For 
        example, older gang members transmit delinquency to younger boys. Which 
        leads to more delinquency. This last point was pulled from the 
        "life stories" of delinquents.

        Shaw and Mckay pulled from the "life stories" to exemplify how the 
        delinquent tradition if transmitted across generations of youths. They 
        provide the example of Sidney Blotzman, who by age 16 had engaged in 
        numerous crimes. He begun his criminal career at age 7, Shaw noted that 
        due to his associations with older delinquents the boy "began to 
        identify himself with the criminal world and to embody in his own 
        philosophy of life the moral values which prevailed in the criminal 
        groups with which he had contact." Shaw reminds us that Sidney lived in 
        a neighborhood with largely disintegrated traditions where criminal 
        groups competed for the lives of the area's children.

        Before parting with the work of Shaw and McKay, it is important to note
        how their work informs other theories. For example, their premise that 
        weakening social controls permit delinquency to take place is an early
        version of what would later become part of the control theories. On the
        other hand, the idea that criminal behavior occurs as a result of 
        cultural transmission gave rise to learning theories. 

        [EXTRA] Backup on the causes:
          - Poor economic conditions where people may have limited access to 
            conventional opportunities, lack of resources to address ongoing 
            problems, and a reliance on illegal or quasi-legal income.
          - Residential instability: Limits the creation of strong social bonds 
            due to constant social disruption (people coming and going) and an 
            impermanence.
          - Ethnic/Racial Heterogeneity breaks a community because of the lack 
            of common norms, communication barriers, and a shift to urban living 
            for people coming into the city. Interestingly Shaw and McKay viewed 
            racial differences in delinquency as a function primarily of 
            location of residence, not racial makeup.

        From Boom to Lean Times
      </h2>
      <p>
        Despite a wave of replication of Shaw and McKay's work (Bordua, 1959; 
        Chilton, 1964; Lander, 1954), the theory lost its appeal &#128533; until 
        the 1980s, resurging in the 1990s. 
        </br></br>
        In the 1980's, criminologist began reconsidered the theory because of 
        an interest in the "ecology" of crime.
        <!--Apparently much of the focus shifted to individual modes of crime-->
        <!--An approach with analyzes ecological units such as neighborhoods, 
          cities, states, or nations.-->
        </br></br>
        Bursick (1988) provided criticisms of the theory that served to 
        layout the academic agenda in the next wave of studies:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The assumption of stable ecological structures</li>
        <!--
          Key to social disorganization are the notions of change and adaptation
          in community, 
          from the theory's roots in human ecology theory. Bursick notes that
          in order to measure disorganization, you need to have longitudinal
          data. His critique here is anchored in the wave of papers that did not
          use longitudinal data as measuring ecological change and delinquency 
          over time are a requirement.
        -->
        <li>The measurement of social disorganization</li>
        <!--
          First, how do we define it?
          Starting with Shaw and McKay, it has been hard to differentiate 
          between the presumed outcome of social disorganization, increased
          rates of delinquency, from disorganization itself. Criminologist in 
          the 80's began making an "operational" distinction to define the 
          concept in terms of the capacity of a neighborhood to regulate itself
          through formal (police and law) and informal (ties between people) 
          processes of social control. This updated definition assumes that the
          breath and strength of local social networks will directly affect the 
          effectiveness of two forms of community self-regulation. We will talk
          in more detail about this reformulation in later slides.          
        -->
        <li>The measurement of crime and delinquency</li>
        <!--
          An over reliance on official data to compute the rates of crime and
          delinquency may only reflect police decision-making practices on where
          to police. Many have argued that systemic bias may obscure the 
          actual distribution of delinquency by focusing only on some 
          "over-policed" communities.

              Sampson and Groves (1989) expanded on prior work by testing the
              idea that informal relations and controls would be weakened, 
              leading to high crime, in communities marked by poverty,
              heterogeneity, residential transiency, and family disruption. Or 
              as they put it: "empirically, the structural dimension of 
              community social disorganization can be measured in terms of 
              prevalence and interdependence of social networks in a community 
              ... and in the span of collective supervision that the community 
              directs toward local problems." (Sampson and Groves 1989, pp. 
              777).
            </li>
            <li>
              Sampson (1986) argued that crime was high in inner cities because
              residents had lost the capacity to exercise "informal social 
              control" (Cullen et al. 2022). For example, coming from a 
              neighborhood with a high number of "broken" homes, were adults 
              are not around to supervise the youth.
            </li>
            <!-- 
              Sampson argues that coming from a broken home is not in 
              itself an issue, rather the problem was coming from a neighborhood 
              with a high proportion of family headed by a single parent where 
              control cannot be exercised effectively.

              While a graduate student, Sampson enrolled in a seminar taught by
              Travis Hirschi who was an advocate of <em>control theory.</em>

              Prior tests on SDT had only measured the structural "antecedents"
              or causes of social disorganization and then examined if these
              factors were related to crime. As they put it "the crux of the 
              problem is that previous macro-level research in crime and 
              delinquency has relied primarily on census data that rarely 
              provide measures for the variables hypothesized to mediate the 
              relationship between community structure and crime." (Sampson and 
              Groves 1989, pp. 775).

              In large part, studies took for granted the social condition

              on the right hand side (delinquency).

            While previous focused primarily on the neighborhood characteristics
            on crime, Sampson and Groves examine the importance of neighborhood 
            organizational characteristics as intervening factors. 

            To do so, they constructed three intervening dimension into their 
            model:
              - Ability of a community to supervise and control teenage peer 
              groups, which was a key mechanism linking community 
              characteristics with delinquency in Shaw and McKay's work.
              - Network density, specifically, dense networks are desired as
              they (1) increase the capacity of community residents to recognize 
              each other and strangers, allowing people to watch out for each 
              other, and (2) exert constraints on deviant behavior of residents 
              in within the community. Sparse networks on the other hand are
              problematic.
              - Low organizational participation is problematic as they view 
              participation in formal and voluntary organizations as an 
              embodiment of local community solidarity.

      <h2>Systemic Control Model of Social Disorganization</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Beginning with Sampson and Grove's work, tests of SDT began drawing 
          from the <em>systemic model</em> of community attachment to measure 
          <em>how</em> communities organize for effective control.
        </li>
        <div class="callout">
          <h4 class="callout-h4">"Fun" Fact &#128161;</h4>
          The systemic model of community attachment views the community as "a 
          complex system of ... networks and formal and informal ... ties 
          rooted in family life and on-going socialization processes" (Kasarda
          and Janowitz 1972).
        </div>
        <li>
          Sampson and Groves presumed that weak social control emerged from an
          absence of ties among neighborhood residents.
        </li>
        <li>
          Robert Bursik and Harold Grasmick (1993) extended this model beyond 
          internal neighborhood ties as sources of organization and control. 
          Their work includes a categories of ties that enhance social control 
          on crime:
          <ul>
            <li>Private: intimate interpersonal ties (e.g., friendship).</li>
            <li>Parochial: shared institutional and organizational ties (e.g., 
              attending the same school).
            </li>
            <li>Public: connection to agencies outside the neighborhood with 
              resources for controlling crime (e.g., local police).

          </ul>
          <li>
            Velez's (2001) examined the value of public ties by studying 60 
            neighborhoods and uncovering that residents' ties to government and 
            police were associated with lower rates of burglary, assault, and 
            mugging.

                Collective efficacy is the "<em>process</em> of activating or 
                converting social ties to achieve desired outcomes" (Sampson et 
                al. 1999).

                  So communities high in collective efficacy can amass a 
                  unified front to make life for delinquents in their 
                  neighborhoods uncomfortable by watching them, telling them to 
                  go elsewhere, and if needed exerting political pressure or 
                  getting the police involved.

              <!-- Introduced by Sampson and Bartusch in 1998 but expanded by 
                Kirk and Papachristos in 2011.-->
              <ul>
                <li>A <em>cultural frame</em> at the <em>community level</em> 
                  "through which individuals interpret the functioning and 
                  viability of the law and its agents, especially law 
                  enforcement. When the law is perceived to be just, legitimate,
                   and responsive then individuals are more likely to cooperate 
                   and comply with the law." (Kirk and Papachristos 2011).</li>
                <!-- 
                  This framework requires an understanding of what influences
                  the perceptions of the law as well as the consequences of
                  cynicism towards the law.
                -->
                <li>Legal cynicism emerges from:
                  <ul>
                    <li>Concentrated disadvantage</li>
                    <!--
                      Concentrated disadvantage leads to legal cynicism b/c
                      it creates alienation from society; namely, a sense that
                      main societal institutions (e.g., police) provide little
                      in the way of economic or personal security. 
                    -->
                    <li>Previous police-resident encounters</li>
                    <!--
                      Previous encounters leads to legal cynicism, especially in
                      disadvantage neighborhoods, b/c there is evidence that 
                      police are less likely to be helpful and more likely to 
                      harass and use force against residents. This is compounded 
                      by the exchange of experiences and information among 
                      residents.

                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  Legal cynicism has consequences for neighborhood rates of 
                  violence because the police are not relied upon to handle 
                  grievances; instead, residents may take matters into their own
                  hands, which may lead to violence.
                  <!--
                    Kirk and Papachristos stress that such violence is not a 
                    reflection of pro-violence values; rather, culturally 
                    defined appropriate action when the police cannot be relied
                    upon.

        How can this theory and extensions be useful?
      </h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Shift the focus from traditional "criminogenic" factors of the 
          individual (e.g., low self-control, anti-social personality) and cast 
          light on urban policies pertaining to infrastructure, poverty reduction,
          and the buildup of social networks that foment informal controls.
        </li>
        <li>
          Networks, not attributes: Most datasets tend to focus on the 
          non-relational characteristics of offenders. However, attributes (e.g.,
          race, education) do not vary across social contexts (e.g.,
          at school, at work) while ties do. This is why social network analysts focus on the 
          patterns of interaction between actors to predict behavior (Cunningham et al. 2015, pp 10). 
          This idea is reflected in the work of McKay and Shaw; namely, in 
          regards to cultural transmission via links to other delinquents. 
          Also crystalized in the words of Wasserman and Faust (2014)
          "Network models focusing on individuals view their network structural 
          environment as providing opportunities for or constraints on individual 
          action". Some use community surveys to capture networks, 
          yet...

      </ul>

        Critique on using surveys for measuring social networks...
      </h2>
      <blockquote class="blockquote text-right">
        <p class="mb-0">
          For the last thirty years, empirical social research has been dominated 
          by the sample survey. But as usually practiced, using random sampling of
          individuals, the survey is a biological meatgrinder, tearing the 
          individual from his social context and guaranteeing that nobody in the 
          study interact with anyone else in it.  It is a little like a biologist 
          putting his experimental animals through a hamburger machine and looking 
          at every hundredth cell through a microscope; anatomy and physiology get 
          lost, structure and function disappear, and one is left with cell biology...
          If our aim is to understand people's behavior rather than simply record 
          it, we want to know about groups, neighborhoods, organizations, social 
          circles, and communities; about interaction, communication, role 
          expectations, and social control.
