# Social Disorganization Theory

This repository contains the notes and papers, code, and other resources used to generated the slides on Social Disorganization Theory as part of the CSG Justice Center Research Division's internal review of criminological theories. 

The slides were primarily build using the [deck.js framework](http://imakewebthings.com/deck.js/) :rocket:. [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) was used for its grid system and components :triangular_ruler:. Lastly, the timeline visualization was generated using [TimelineJS](https://timeline.knightlab.com/#preview-embed), which made the process a delight :alarm_clock:.
